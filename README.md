# About Time
<first title was unity thought thats what I wanna talk about>

OK, so first of all, I've written this essay for me, don't owe you a damn thing!
It's all gonna sound like cliches and bullshit you heard a million times before.
It won't be a timeless piece. Timefull rather, least original. You shouldn't see this as a blueprint of anything, quote or adopt it in your work and life.
Fuck that shit! Draw your own conclusions.

# What's wrong with this world?

Nothing! I stand corrected, everything!

People kill each other. Greedy assheads rule. We struggle to put food on the table, worried that there won't be a table soon, eviction is coming if I don't make this month's rent!

Yet, life is a deceptively beautiful son of a gun! Trees are green, babies make you laugh, sun will shine for the foreseeable future. Rockets are gonna take us to visit moon for a vacation! How fucking cool is that?

I think this world is a scam. We need to crash and burn it and build a new one. In no possible world the likes of Trump, Biden and Elon Musk should be anywhere near power. They're all delusional! Two of them wouldn't know they've pissed themselves, debatable which two!

This essay attempts to formulate a plan to reimagine the world, and reformat it in that image.

BTW, you don't need to read the whole thing, here's the algorithm in a few lines:
1. Challenge Authority
2. Empathize with everything in between until you meet the Authority
3. Replace Authority with an up-to-date system
4. Iterate!

If you're more mathematically minded:

```tex
life = meaning / Î” time
```

# God does not exist!

Or does he? Or she? Or ze?! Anyhow, that fucking thing is the biggest scam of all. Ah also, anytime you felt like this has started to offend you, feel free to close whatever medium you're perceiving it from! There's extensive literature about this, so I'll just say, God is a quantum state IFF it exists. But so are we, the people, all. So fuck god.

You see, as a programming language, even English is broken. Someone reads "Fuck God" and thinks I hate god, someone else will read it and think I wanna be intimate with god. The reality is I'm indifferent about the concept, and find it amusing and interesting, because it's grabbed so much attention during the course of history! But I won't loop through it, I know it's a `while (true)` situation. I listen when people talk, but avoid contributing to an infinite loop :D

# Singularity / Messiah / Imam of time

Another futile pursuit. This has been prophesized in all cultures I happened upon. IT'S A BIG FUCKING LIE. We're in the constant state of singularity. There is no spoon!

The Kurzweilian Singularity predicts a new era: Stone, Bronze, ..., Modern Era, `"Exponential Discovery"`. He's a scam artist! There will be another age, after we travel faster than light. Big woof!

# Artificial General Intelligence

Heh, you get the drill here? Well, this one probably isn't a scam. And I say "probably" only because we haven't made the damn thing yet. But we're about to. It won't give us superintelligence, not that the hypothesis is wrong, because the universe too is in a state of singularity, it generates problems in a faster rate.

# Life is meaning over time

This one screams it's a fact. It's my (current) 42: the answer to life, universe, and everything. I came up with it while taking a shit, I dunno, an hour ago? It takes different forms in my mind and regurgitates all over the place every day. Had me committed to a psychiatric hospital in 2012. It's a less cryptic starting point than 42, but I won't surrender my 42 for anything. It's forever immortalized in my son's middle and last name!

It doesn't matter where you start from, equilibrium, singularity, peekaboo, Allaho Akbar! Conclusions are the same. You'll rediscover everything! Meaning is defragmentation of the things you learn, during your life.

# Are you watching closely?

This means that every movie you watched is a documentary. You weren't the only person in the world who watched that movie, right? So, amongst those who watched, there's definitely been people who empathized with at least one character throughout. Hence, that character has lived! Same for every book, cave carving, etc. By generalization, no original idea ever existed! Inventions are morphic restructuring of previous thoughts. Smart and genius are very scammy words, we all have an almost identical brain cell structure, lots of deaf and blind geniuses!

The only given fact is the star systems, and how they make us dance to the song of uni/multiverse.

# Me / Self / Soul / Consciousness

Hello world! My name is Keyvan. Just trying to grab data points that are relevant to `life = meaning / time` here. I was born in Iran. Lots of names sound like mine there: eeee aaaa! 

Similar to everywhere else, there's a shit show in that country, as you've probably heard. Contradicting belief systems, diverse races and cultures. You name it, we got it. This environment provides enough entropy to generate a vibrant youth population. You'll hear different versions, depending on whom you ask from. The reality in the streets though, is that everyone keeps up to date with technology. We find creative ways to stay connected to the rest of the world. Any environment that's not completely isolated, converges with the rest of the world.

In the midst of this, I was born! A curious boy, son to parents who were neither religious, nor atheist. By the age of five, I observed my first singularity, my baby sister. She was a wrecking ball, destroying the establishment and authority that I worked so hard to build until that age! Ever since, I look forward to meeting singularities everywhere I go.

# Bipolar

Manic episodes are bugs in my system. They lead to generating useless content like this. You feel inspired and think you found the key to solving every problem in the world. You feel obligated to write it down or paint it up or whatever. Art: that's what this is. It's a transform function. That's what religion is, and why it keeps reappearing in endless forms.

# Joule Meter

Each time you wanna break out of this loop, take a look directly in front, at present moment. If you're doing stuff and not thinking about your religion constantly, then you're good! If you get back here, you're just letting off some steam, nothing more significant. Learn arts, games and crafts, burn some calories. That's all there is to do!
